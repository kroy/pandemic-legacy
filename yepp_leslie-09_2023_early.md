September got off to a good start. This strain of Rigatonitis was particularly weak. Dr. Tortellini and I found a cure earlier ~today~ yesterday and sent the formula out to the pharma factories for production. I wanted to hold back and be sure, but she convinced me of the urgency of the situation, so I relented.

The treatment for this strain of Rigatonitis seems to be working. Treatments for Boneitis and C.O.W. are progressing well, or at least that's what my colleagues are assuring me. We've eliminated most of the trouble spots, and everything seems to be quiet. I'm skeptical though. While we're taking care of the nice white people in the Western Hemisphere, Asia festers. Every day, more people are presenting with symptoms of CoDa --  and we can't do anything except tighten the noose around them. We've been sending soldiers with guns and grenades to deal with these people, when we should be sending medics with food, medicine and comfort. I feel like the CDC has been so focused on supporting the military solution that we've lost sight of the long-term. Where does this all end? Nobody has been looking for a cure, and it seems like those that have have disappeared or been marginalized. I dunno. I haven't been sleeping much, so this is probably the exhaustion talking. But something feels... wrong about this whole situation.

For some reason, they deployed me to Jakarta to look for some soldier that went AWOL. He used to be a 'liaison' at the CDC, one of those GOP commissars attached to the CDC at the beginning of the Trump's 2nd term to ensure that the Centers stayed 'on message'. I don't remember him specifically, but he can rot in CoDa infested hell for all I care.

**HOLY SHIT.....** 
Holy fucking shit. I *knew* it. I knew there was something off about this WHOLE THING. I KNEW we were spending way too much time and energy supporting the military response to this crisis. I knew nobody was paying enough attention to finding a cure. I KNEW CoDa mutated way too quickly. It was all planned. All calculated. And while we spun in circles, barely containing the disaster unfolding around us, the government cut our funding. Of *course* they did, because IT WAS ALL PLANNED. This is all a conspiracy to justify and expand the global fascist conspiracy that Trump and his cronies have been building since DAY 1. I've always suspected that something like this was going on, and I've prepared for the possibility, but I always thought I was a bit paranoid. Now I know. And I will resist.
