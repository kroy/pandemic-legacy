We're reeling from Zodiac's bullshit, but we've still got a job to do. This month's flavor of **C.O.W** isn't too bad, and seems to be localized to Central Europe and North Africa. We might stand a chance of eradicating this strain and learning something about how to treat future strains. Optimism. I know. I must be sick. But I think this whole Zodiac thing has really unburdened me. I've always felt like there've been conspiracies swirling around me, but I've always been too 'rational' to really pursue them. Now I know. And I'll NEVER make that mistake again.

We've cured **C.O.W.** and now we're working on **Bone-itis**. I'm even out in the field again, treating people in the Eastern US. Maybe I'll pay Trump and his Zodiac lackeys a little visit. Show them a taste of their own medicine. Or opposite of medicine. Whatever.

Peter Fungus, the crazy immunologist we found wandering around in faded Shanghai, still insists he needs a DNA sample from a faded person (person who is faded?) in order to continue his work. I don't know what he's looking for. Santa Bear and Bob have been giving him samples from all of their trips to the faded zones, but he's never satisfied with any of them. I respect his caution and his dedication to the scientific method, but I wish he would just get on with it! If I didn't have to focus on all the other shit exploding around the world, I'd have **CoDa** cured in 2 seconds...

Speaking of exploding... We've eradicated **C.O.W.**, cured **Bone-itis** and **Rigatonitis**, and now it's time to BLOW SOME SHIT UP. A couple new nodes in the Zodiac network have popped up over the next few days. Bob and Santa Bear think they're vulnurable to attack. So we're gonna take the fight to them. I wish I was there to see the looks on those fuckers' faces when they realize that humanity isn't just gonna roll over and be ruled by a bunch of totalitarian Lizard People!

Well our job here is done. For now. **CoDa** and the other diseases are under control. A couple of Zodiac nodes got taken out. And we're getting closer to a cure. We're headed back to our safehouse in Istanbul to regroup and plan our next move. The people united will not be defeated.
